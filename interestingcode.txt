// interesting colors 
White or Off-White (#FFFFFF or #F5F5F5): These colors will stand out against darker or mid-tone browns and greys, making your text readable. Off-white may be softer and more elegant than pure white, so it could blend better with a more natural aesthetic.
Light Grey (#D3D3D3): A light grey could create enough contrast without feeling too stark. It’s a subtler option but still legible.
Beige or Cream (#F1E4D1): If you want to keep the text warm and aligned with the natural tones of the background, a soft beige or cream could look good. It provides contrast but still feels warm and neutral.
Warm Taupe (#B98B6A): For a more sophisticated and harmonious look, a warm taupe or light brown with some yellow undertones could stand out well without clashing with the background.
Charcoal or Dark Grey (#333333 or #444444): If you want a darker text that’s still readable on lighter grey or brown backgrounds, charcoal or dark grey can offer good contrast while feeling less harsh than black.
Soft Gold or Bronze (#B08D57 or #C38A58): If you want a touch of elegance or luxury, a soft metallic gold or bronze could contrast beautifully with browns and greys without being too bold or distracting.
